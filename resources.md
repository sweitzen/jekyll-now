A collection of useful resources for learning about data science - contains only classes and books I have completed:

* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)  
  - [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), by Johns Hopkins University  
    A 10-course sequence building data science skill with R programming.
  - [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), by Andrew Ng and Stanford University  
    An 11-week class covering machine learning algorithms using [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave), an
    open-source equivalent to MATLAB. You'll get a good grounding in how these algorithms work.
  - [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), by Andrew Ng and deeplearning.ai  
    A five-course sequence in deep neural networks, including introduction to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 
    and [Keras](https://keras.io).
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com)
  - [Docker Mastery: The Complete Toolset from a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery)  
    [What is Docker?](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) You can use Docker to test out a new technology (e.g., Mongo, 
    PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, etc.) without needing to install or configure it. You can configure a deep neural network 
    model in Docker, and easily deploy to AWS.
* Books
  - [Ry's Git Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QFIA5OC/)  
    This is an excellent project-based introduction to using git. It's concise, and will get you going with the

    an excellent introduction to the Linux command line, its essential tools, and bash scripting.
  - [OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Ed](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os)  
    An excellent introduction or review of basic statistics.
  - [Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Applications to Computer Science](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Matrix-Algebra-Applications-Computer/dp/0615880991/)  
    Linear algebra is the foundation of nearly all machine learning. This book is an excellent resource.
  - [R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Advanced-Analytics-Graphics-Addison-Wesley/dp/013454692X/)
