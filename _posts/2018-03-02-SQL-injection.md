I started reading [Essential SQLAlchemy: Mapping Python to Databases, 2nd Ed](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-SQLAlchemy-Mapping-Python-Databases/dp/149191646X/)
yesterday. Starting Chapter 2 (Working with Data via SQLAlchemy Core), I encounter the sentence, 
"Parameters are used to help ensure that our data has been properly escaped, which mitigates security 
issues such as SQL injection attacks", and I immediately recall this xkcd comic:
